1. What is your favorite programming language? Why?

2. Do you know CSS? How would you rate yourself in CSS?

3. Do you know React? How would you rate yourself in React?

4. Write a function to remove duplicates from a sorted array. Use any language
   of your choice.

```python
assert(unique([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

5. Write the following function, that splits passed `arr` into two arrays, the
   first containing values smaller than the `value` and the second array
   containing values larger than the `value`.

```python
assert(partition([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7]) == [[1, 2], [4, 5, 7]])
```

6. Write a function `mergeSorted` which merges two sorted arrays into a sorted
   array with the time complexity of `O(n)` and space complexity of `O(n)`.

```python
assert(mergeSorted([1, 3, 5], [2, 4]) == [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
```
