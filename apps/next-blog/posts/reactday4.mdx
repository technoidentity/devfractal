**_Principles of React:_**

UI is constructed by invoking a function which return a value(vdom) and the
value which is returned is based on props that are passed to function.

props -> function/pure function -> vdom

Function repesents props in the form of vdom by doing data transformation.
Imagine if the function is pure function then props will not change so does
vdom.

Everytime props changes function will returns a differnt view(vdom) where we can
say that the function is not pure and does the side effect.

**_Disadvantages of manipulating DOM directly:_**

> - Imagine there is no react and we have to change the DOM directly to mutate
>   ui being DOM as mutative library changing multiple things will lead to
>   difficulty in managing state.
> - mutating one thing at one place may lead to mutation in another place which
>   leads to difficulty keeping synchronization between UI and program
>   logic.There is no easy way changing HTML and CSS without effecting the
>   programmer.
> - Make sure that the query selectors are as general as possible and do not
>   break easily.
> - Imagine there are lot of DOM objects as well as functions for manipulating
>   DOM and each object is maintaining its own state.State is distributed among
>   the objects and each object is pointing to another object and each object
>   accessing a global variable then state would be unpredictable.

**_How React solves the problem:_**

- A single page can be divided into multiple components.Props can be distributed
  to these multiple components eventually lead to building VDOM.
- Imagine each component is a pure function being fed with props each function
  render a VDOM which leads to more predictable code. Even if a bug occurs we
  can easily identify the respective component and debug it.
- This mental model is so unrealistic where as keeping every component is pure
  in order to change UI we need to change the props.
- React solves this by keeping rendering components pure at the same time
  keeping state explicitly.

## **Reactive Programming:**

**_Reactive variables:_**

> - variables contains a reference to immutable values. we can always get a
>   current value from the variable and also can provide with previous value if
>   its been stored might get a next value.Each one of these values are
>   immutable. Anybody accessing these immutable values cant change these
>   values.
> - Whenever the variable value changes there should a mechanism that we can
>   poll the that change.
> - Those variables which always refers to a value which have an identity which
>   can tell others change in their value with their time are called Reactive
>   variables.

**_Derived values:_**

- Derived values are values which are dependent on reactive variable.
- Derived values can be obtaining a value from providing reactive variable to a
  pure function.
- Reactive variable can not contain another reactive variable but derived
  variable can be derived from another derived variable or reactive variable.
- By keeping reactive variables as minimal as possible and independent with each
  other and make it as a seperate layer with derived variables to extent solve
  the problem of inconsistency.
