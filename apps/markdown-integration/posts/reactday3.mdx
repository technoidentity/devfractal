- React allows to represent a view as data. React has ability to treat a view as a function which takes props as data and returns data
  as value.

> A web page is nothing but collection of react components. Each component is nothing but a function which takes data and returns a view.

**Component:** <br/>

- A React component can be described as a function which takes a value(props) and returns a value(jsx Element).

- JSX Element can be created using React.createElement.

```jsx
const HelloWorld = () =>
  React.createElement("div", { style: { color: "red" } }, "Hello world");
```

> Above is a react component is nothing but a pure function where does not have any side effects and returns a JSX element

React.createElement() takes three arguments. They are:

- **type**: the type of the HTML element (h1,p,button).
- **props**: properties of the object or Eventhandlers, classNames,etc).
- **children**: anything that need to be displayed on the screen.

```jsx
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(React.createElement(HelloWorld));
```

> document.getElementById will give a DOM Object.That DOM object will be passed to createRoot which is a react function. As we can see we dont have to invoke HelloWorld all by ourself where react will take care of rendering it by itself.

JSX Element is nothing but a javascript object which consists of _tags_, _attributes_ and _children_.

React component always take one parameter which is a prop object.For example

<Youtube id="oWVW8IqpQ-A" />

```jsx
const HelloWorld = ({ message }) =>
  React.createElement("div", { style: { color: "red" } }, message);

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(React.createElement(HelloWorld, { message: "hello" }));
```

React enables XML like syntax in order to create JSX Elements in simpler syntax.

```jsx
const HelloWorld = () => <div>Hello world</div>;
```

> `<div>Hello world</div>` This would internally converted into `React.createElement('div',{},"Hello world")`

We can write any javascript expression with in our JSX by using {}

```jsx
const HelloWorld = ({ message }) => <div>{message}</div>;
```

React component with proper naming conventions and props followed by types is as follows

```jsx
type HelloWorldProps = Readonly<{
  message: string,
}>;

const HelloWorld = ({ message }: HelloWorldProps) => (
  <div>{message.toUpperCase().trim()}</div>
);

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HelloWorld message=" hello world " />);
```

## **Counter**

Before writing any React component steps that are need to be followed:

**_Step 1:_** Make sure to write a static structure of the component at first.

```jsx
const Counter = () => (
    <div>+</div>
    <div>count</div>
    <div>-</div>
)
```

**_Step 2:_** Make sure component allows props as data.

```jsx
type CounterProps = {
    count:number
}

const Counter = ({count}:CounterProps) => {
return (
    <div>+</div>
    <div>{count}</div>
    <div>-</div>
)
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Counter count={10}/>)
```

> The above Counter component takes a value as prop returns a JSX Element and does not do anything else such as changing a value or changing a view is refered as a **Stateless Component**. A Stateless component always refered as a **Pure Function**.

```

```
